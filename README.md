# Daytona USA Script Utilities & Presets
Daytona USA Batch Scripts and Utilities Setup for Model 2 Emulator

# setup
1. get model 2 emulator files from here: https://archive.org/details/m2emu1.1a
2. download m2emulator.zip
3. then copy and paste the emulator files to the directory you downloaded the utils in (with .ini config file(s) deselected)
4. do the same thing with m2emulator2, 3, 4, and online directories
5. create a "roms" folder for each of those directories
6. obtain a working rom .zip archive of daytona usa (daytona.zip) (one rom is currently obtainable in the previous link on step 1)
7. (optional) configure the controls for your machine by starting daytona usa and going to Game > Configure Controls in the windowed mode of the emulator (to exit fullscreen, hit ESC)
8. apply the configuration to m2emulator2, 3, 4, and online CFG directories by copying and pasting the updated daytona.input from your current CFG path
(by default, daytona.input is set to a XInput gamepad controller map)
9. open start.bat from the root directory to config and autostart the game and enjoy!

# notes
to use the netplay feature on the internet and not only LAN, you and your friends must port forward the listening ports on your modems. (default port for netplay is 1978)

IF you are changing the game settings in test mode, please be very careful when doing it and make sure the settings are the same for all other datafiles EXCEPT for link id, car number, and cabinet.

**(ONLY mess with the game settings and emulator configurations in this configuration if you already know how everything works!!!)**
